# AI-Based Phishing Detection System

An end-to-end machine learning system that detects phishing URLs using supervised learning. This project includes data ingestion, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, a Flask REST API for real-time predictions, and a JavaScript-based web interface for user interaction.

## Overview

Phishing attacks remain one of the most common cybersecurity threats, relying on deceptive URLs to compromise users and systems. This project addresses the problem by applying machine learning techniques to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate. The system is designed as a complete pipeline, from dataset ingestion and model training to API deployment and frontend integration.
